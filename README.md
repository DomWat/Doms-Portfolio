## For the Future
In the process of looking for a contract or fulltime position that will allow me to use the fullstack abilities I have gained from my time at DigitalCrafts Fullstack bootcamp. Currently continuing to work on improving my abilities using react and redux. After this will continue working on improving my skills and hopefully in the not so distant future I can learn a new language such as Swift or Java.
